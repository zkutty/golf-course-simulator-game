Original prompt: Update my vision HTML for the new features from the new milestones added to linear

## 2026-07-23

- Identified `golf-sim` as the matching Linear project.
- Reviewed the newly added M36–M44 roadmap and its available issue breakdown.
- Scope for the vision update: Player Pro direct golf and growth, play-informed architecture feedback, persistent people and stories, seasons and club identity, rebuilt campaign, premium presentation, desktop/Steam, Workshop, and release certification.

## Implemented

- Added a new `Play It` navigation target and premium-roadmap section.
- Added six story cards covering M36–M44 and a Build → Play → Understand → Redesign loop.
- Updated the hero and north-star copy to include playing the course through the Player Pro.
- Added responsive desktop/tablet/mobile styling and focused E2E assertions/screenshots.

## TODO

- No known follow-up work for this request.

## Verification

- `npm run build` passes. Existing Vite chunk-size warnings remain unchanged.
- `npm run lint` passes with seven pre-existing React Hooks warnings and no errors.
- `git diff --check` passes.
- The web-game Playwright client loads `/?view=vision` without console errors and reports the expected menu state.
- Focused vision E2E passes on desktop and a 390×844 mobile viewport (2 tests).
- Visually inspected the hero, desktop roadmap introduction/grid, and mobile roadmap introduction/grid. Copy, contrast, wrapping, spacing, and sticky navigation are readable at both sizes.
